Automated Testcases

In order to run this suite:

1. Clone the repository, go to Pathfactory folder
2. Do npm install in the project folder, to install all dependencies
3. To run the test, in the terminal of the project folder run npm test
4. To run test in sauce labs,, npm test-sauce

To complete this assignment, I have used WebdriverIO with Mocha framework. For assertion, a library called chaijs is also used. Also I have run the test in Safari and Chrome in Saucelabs
